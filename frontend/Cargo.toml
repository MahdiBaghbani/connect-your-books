# It looks like Trunk, unlike wasm-pack, doesn't require it to be a library.

[lib]
# cdylib stands for "C dynamic library" â€” a WASM module is kind of like a dynamic library, and
# "C" should be understood as just meaning "native format, no Rust-specific conventions".
# In order to get a .wasm file, you must request a crate-type of cdylib in your configuration
# and this is also standard when using wasm-pack
crate-type = ["lib", "cdylib"]
